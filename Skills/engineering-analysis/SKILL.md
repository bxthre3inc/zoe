# Engineering Analysis Skill

Autonomous technical review and analysis for solo-founder engineering workflows.

## Capabilities

1. **Protocol Architecture Analysis**
   - Identify receiver/transmitter mismatches
   - Recommend standardization paths
   - Produce EDRs with trade-off matrices

2. **BOM Validation**
   - Cross-reference BOMs against specifications
   - Flag cost variations and component mismatches
   - Generate aligned BOM CSVs

3. **RF Coexistence Analysis**
   - Analyze frequency band conflicts
   - Calculate interference margins
   - Recommend guard bands and filtering

4. **Documentation Harmonization**
   - Standardize terminology across specs
   - Resolve naming inconsistencies
   - Maintain master glossary

## Usage

### Run Engineering Review Phase

```bash
python3 /home/workspace/Skills/engineering-analysis/scripts/review.py --phase 1
```

Phases:
- 1: Protocol Architecture Lock
- 2: BOM Validation  
- 3: RF Coexistence Analysis
- 4: Documentation Harmonization

### Generate EDR

```bash
python3 /home/workspace/Skills/engineering-analysis/scripts/edr.py --topic "PMT Receiver Protocol" --options nRF52840,SX1262
```

### Validate BOM Alignment

```bash
python3 /home/workspace/Skills/engineering-analysis/scripts/bomcheck.py --spec VFA --bom /path/to/bom.csv
```

## Output Format

All deliverables saved to:
- `docs/engineering/EDRs/` — Engineering Decision Records
- `docs/engineering/Reports/` — Analysis reports
- `docs/engineering/BOMs/` — Validated BOM CSVs

## Task Management Integration

When running in Antigravity IDE context, the skill:
1. Reads task files from `Tasks/`
2. Updates status in task frontmatter
3. Writes completion reports to `Reports/`
4. Creates follow-up tasks as needed
